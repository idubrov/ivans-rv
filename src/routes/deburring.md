My deburring setup is currently the following:

- 6" Scotch-Brite deburring wheel, 7A Medium (Aircraft Spruce part number [12-00875](https://www.aircraftspruce.com/catalog/topages/scotchdeburrwheel.php)). This is a good universal deburring wheel that leaves very good finish. At the same time, it is relatively aggressive for rounding corners of thin aluminum angles, ribs, skins and so on.
- 6" Scotch-Brite deburring wheel, 7S Softer (Aircraft Spruce part number [12-00948](https://www.aircraftspruce.com/catalog/topages/scotchdeburrwheel.php)). Softer version of the previous wheel. More gentle for thinner parts (FIXME: update with experience).
- 1" Scotch-Brite cut and polish unitized wheel (7A Medium), got from [Planetools](https://planetools.com/). Initially used for skin on practice projects, but found that skins cut a groove in the wheel pretty quick.
- 1" aluminum oxide cloth roll (220 grit), from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D5KVWHD).
- 2" Quick change Scatch-Brite discs (part number 476Z48, Zoro part number [G1197979](https://www.zoro.com/scotch-brite-quick-change-disc-non-woven-8-dia-476z48/i/G1197979). Gray (blue disc) is the softest and works the best for skins.
- Sanding cord, files, sandpaper, Shaviv deburring tools.
