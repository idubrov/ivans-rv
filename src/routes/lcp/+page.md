This page is a summary of my assessment of the [laser-cut parts issue](https://www.vansaircraft.com/2023/07/information-about-dimpled-hole-cracking-on-some-laser-cut-parts/) that Vans Aircraft announced on July 21st, 2023. 

I made a local copy of some of the documents published by Vans Aircraft. Note that these are possibly not the latest versions, just the ones I used at the time.

My [inventoring of the laser-cut parts](/blog/2023/08/21/inventoring-laser-cut-parts).

## Status

At the time the fuselage was almost fully assembled, but it only had two potentially "blue" parts ("Acceptable for Use") as per the document -- the F-656 gussets. I remember removing blue plastic from these parts, which made my parts to be the punched ones.

The wing kit has a few parts listed as "red" ("Replacement Recommended"), but all mine are punched ones.

<!-- todo: include a photo of the parts inspected? -->

However, I have pretty much every single part listed in the "blue" category as laser-cut ones, all the wing ribs and the fuel tank baffles. I will be replacing them no matter what. Just one less thing to worry about. Some of them look okay, but the holes are still noticeably out of round.  

The empennage kit is a tricky one. I got it shipped somewhere around 4/27/2022, which is after Vans started using third-party vendors to make some of the parts using CNC laser.

Looking at the photos I took when I opened the boxes ([photo 1](1-package-opened.jpeg), [photo 2](2-inventory-parts.jpeg)), it seems like all the long parts have blue plastic film on them, which makes them punched ones. These are the various spars.

Some of the ribs don't have the plastic film. However, I have some experience in hobby machining, and I am confident that I would have noticed if the holes were out of round. So, I think these are punched ones as well. Though, this is not a 100% assessment.

I will look through the photos to see if I can rule out some of the parts as punched ones.

In the grand scheme of things, rebuilding the whole empennage wouldn't be such a hassle if not for the fact that I have already drilled it to the fuselage. However, this is not an unsolvable problem (I'm sure I can figure out a technique to match-drill the holes without damaging the ones in the fuselage). 

I don't think I have enough evidence to say I have any laser-cut parts in the empennage, so for now, I will assume it is okay as is (I wouldn't mind rebuilding the rudder, though).
