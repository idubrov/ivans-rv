Hello! My name is Ivan, and this is my build log for a Van's Aircraft RV-7 project, #75069.

RV-7 is a side-by-side seat airplane from [Van's Aircraft](https://www.vansaircraft.com/). What you buy from them is a "kit", a set of parts in 4 sub-kits (empennage, wings, fuselage, and finishing kit). Then it is your job to finish the parts, assemble them into an airframe, and complete it with an engine, avionics plus other pieces to get a functional airplane!

The project is in an early stage. I am mostly done with my [empennage kit](/category/empennage). Currently, I am working on the aft fuselage since my wing kit got delayed.

I am building in my garage at this point. This website is to document the process, both for my entertainment and for the documentation purposes.
