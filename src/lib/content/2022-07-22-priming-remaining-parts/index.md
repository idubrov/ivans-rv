Today I was preparing the parts for the left elevator.

<!-- more -->

Not much, mostly drilling / deburring / scuffing and priming the remaining parts for the left elevator. Now that I have accurate scales, I weighted the parts to see how much primer I add. It came to about 2-3%, which is quite a bit. I don't think I was priming too thick this time, but maybe.

Also, finally got my private pilot certificate (which is what kept me busy the last week)!
