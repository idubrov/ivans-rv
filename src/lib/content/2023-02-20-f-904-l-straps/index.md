A short session today -- F-904-L straps.

<!-- more -->

Took me much longer than it should have. I had to remake straps multiple times, for some silly reasons. Two were not clamped enough and moved when I drilled them. Two I did not like the fit, initially, I started with holes centered, but then changed it so that edge of the strap is aligned with the edges of the F-704 parts.
