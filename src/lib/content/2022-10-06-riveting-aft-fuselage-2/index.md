I keep having issues with clecoes falling from some holes. They mostly stay fine, but once I start riveting, some of them fall off. Also, if hole was just a bit misaligned during the drilling, clecoes won't hold very well, too. 

The solution I found was to slighly adjust the clecos to make them spread a bit more when closed. Partially open a cleco, then use thin nose pliers to bend the "mandibles" apart.
