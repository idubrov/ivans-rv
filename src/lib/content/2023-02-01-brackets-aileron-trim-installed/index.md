Riveted the crotch strap brackets and installed the aileron trim today.

First, I riveted the crotch strap brackets with the pull rivets. This time, the holes match enough that I can screw the floors!

Then I installed the aileron trim to the seat ribs. It took quite a bit of time to drill the holes! First, I put the servo where I needed it and marked the location of the holes with the biggest drill bit that would fit through the servo holes. Then I drilled the holes using a #40 drill bit from my angle drill kit and made sure that it matches the servo holes well. Upsized the holes to #30 and then I used a reamer to open the hole to #28 so #6 screws fit through it.

Attaching the servo with the screws was quite an ordeal due to poor access!
