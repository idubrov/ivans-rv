Today I riveted the right elevator understructure

<!-- more -->

As a first step, I assembled the component that holds the trim servo in the left elevator.

Note the smaller heads for the NAS1097 rivets. I could have counter-sinked the trim cover plate for the normal AN426AD3 rivet, but it would have left me with the knife-edge hole.

The clearance on the aft two rivets is really tight!

Then I proceeded with the assembly of the understructure. First, I riveted the spar and the ribs together. You can see that I forgot to dimple the holes. This is not a big deal as they could be dimpled later (although, it is more convenient to dimple when everything is apart!).

I had to resort to my flat dimpling bucking bar to dimple the trailing holes on the ribs. I tried to use close quarter dimple dies, but they did not produce good dimples. Maybe, the nails I use are too small and this does not allow dies to properly center in the hole. #30 dies worked much better.

Then I riveted the counterbalance skin and the skin together with four rivets. This allows using the solid rivets, as otherwise, you have to use blind rivets as there will be no access to the inside part.

Finally, I clecoed the skins to the understructure to make sure everything aligns well. At this point, I've remembered that I am supposed to put some amount of tank sealant on the stiffeners to tie them together. Good thing I haven't started riveting yet!
