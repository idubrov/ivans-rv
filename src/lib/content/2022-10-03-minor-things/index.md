Few minor things on a Sunday.

<!-- more -->

I got my SteinAir [Garmin Remote Unit Template Kit](https://www.steinair.com/product/garmin-remote-units-templates-acrylic/) which I used to see which nutplates I need on my right ELT bracket (the plan is to install Artex 345). None of the existing holes matched, so I drilled four new holes for the nutplates. I compared the SteinAir template to the Artex 345 documentation, and it seems like there is a match. Hopefully, this means the unit will fit just fine.

Also, I drilled the holes for the cable ties to attach the static lines. Initially, I was considering gluing standoffs but then figured there is no need to complicate that part of the installation. So I drilled the holes according to the plans.
