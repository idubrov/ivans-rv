Today I mostly worked on the F711 bulkhead.

<!-- more -->

Drilled the bars to the F711 bulkhead and fabricated an angle to go on it.

I did some other small tasks, too: drilled F712 bulkhead parts to each other, and drilled holes for the static lines on two of the bulkheads. Also, I started doing some deburring.

The remaining work is mostly the F-706 bulkhead. I am waiting for the angles I ordered from Aircraft Spruce to finish it. I did not have the material for one of the angles (I assume, it comes in the wing kit, which I am only going to get in December at best).
