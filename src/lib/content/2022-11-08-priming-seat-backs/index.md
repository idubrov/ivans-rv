Yet another priming session today. 

<!-- more -->

I started the work session by drilling the bellcrank holes to size. Also, I incorporated the hole for the Garmin autopilot servo as well.

Then was the same old story: scuffing everything, then shooting the primer. I primed the seat back parts and pushrods as well.
