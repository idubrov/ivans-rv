Few more rivets in the aft fuselage.

<!-- more -->

All I did was about 12 rivets, 6 rivets on each side, on the aft of the flange of the F-711 bulkhead. After placing shims under the aft flanges (0.032" on one side and 0.25" on the other side), the skin can be pulled tight to the flanges.

There are two shims and one doubler per side. Terrible! The shims allow the skin to be flat to the flanges and the doubler fixes an issue with an edge distance of the flap that goes over the J-channel.

There is a slight crease / dent on the skin, but overall it looks okay. The fuselage is not fully straight if I put a ruler against it, but Van's support says it is not a structural issue. They suggested using shims, but I think I have enough of them. Won't be pretty, but will be structurally sound.
