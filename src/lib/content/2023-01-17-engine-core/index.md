Today I purchased a used engine to use as a core!

The engine is an IO-360-M1 engine built at Aero Sport Power in 2006.

It has about 2154 hours, and it started making some small amount of aluminum recently. The oil analysis company recommended watching the trend and assumed that it might be a cylinder and the rings. Since I am planning to overhaul the engine, I am not too concerned about the cylinders' health. My primary concern is the crankcase, the crankshaft, the camshaft, and the connecting rods.

The plan is to get the tools needed to take it apart and disassemble it. First, this would give me a first impression of what did I get. Second, I am concerned about the corrosion if I leave it as-is. Pickling it would be an option, but some tricks to make sure the camshaft is covered with oil (turning the engine upside down) are difficult to execute without having the equipment to manage it. My thinking is that having individual parts would let me individually protect each part with some corrosion inhibitor (LPS-3?) and monitor them. Also, since I don't care about the cylinders and the pistons, I can get rid of them now.
