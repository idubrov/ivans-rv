Today I only spent half an hour to start modifying the seat ribs.

I used my 1-1/5" hole saw to drill the holes in the ribs. It worked well. I kept the RPM low and made sure that the part is sufficiently clamped.

Then I used my manual nibbler to cut the opening. Also, I drilled the holes for the electrical wiring.
