Over the last couple of days, I was preparing the rear spar parts.

<!-- more -->

First, I trimmed the reinforcement fork and its doubler as per plans. The square in the center is roughly where I will need to place the center of the rear spar bolthole.

Then there was a lot of deburring. The thick parts I had to deburr with the file first, then on the deburring wheels. The rear spars were a bit tricky to deburr due to their dimensions. After deburring the spars themselves, the deburring wheel is pretty much gone!

Then I marked the trim line on the flap brace. The manual says to trim it from one notch to another, but I want to maximize the edge distance on the hole that is closest to the trim line.

It's kind of hard to see what's going on in the photo. What I did is I clecoed the flap brace under the reinforcement fork and used the marker to draw a line.

Then I moved on to drilling the doublers. Nothing too complicated, first I clecoed them to the spars.

Then drilled the holes.

After that -- a bit of work with the Unibit to cut the majority of the material of the hole for the aileron pushrod, and a lot of filing to bring these holes to the dimensions.
