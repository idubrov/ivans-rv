The next step for the horizontal stabilizer was to deburr all of the parts to prepare them for the priming session.

I was specifically looking for the pistol grip tool as a figured it would be more convenient for the type of operations I am anticipating. I found one on the [Yardstore](https://www.yardstore.com/pistol-grip-cleco-installation-tool)

Initially, I did not like it because it was not pressing clecoes hard enough. As a result, they won't fit into the hole or wouldn't go out of the hole. So far I have not find any way to adjust the tool.

However, it worked amazingly well for removing and installing clecoes into the final sized holes. So fast!

I will use it more and see if it still needs some adjustment for undersized hole. Maybe, I can glue some washer into the piston or something like that.

I also bought myself a [Main Squeeze](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/products/main-squeeze-model-22), with the idea that it will work better for less straightforward rivets (assembling ribs and spars, for example). For the vertical stabilizer, I used a pneumatic squeezer. It works well if you can set it square on the rivet. However, in some cases, you can only reach the factory head with the movable anvil and only when it is partially extended. I tried to feather trigger such that it extends the anvil, but does not apply the full pressure. Generally, it works, but if you press trigger a bit too much, it might bite without being square on the rivet. As a result, you get smiles or other type of damage.

So my theory is that with the manual squeezer, I will be able to slowly approach the rivet in whatever position would be the most convenient and then set the rivet in a slow and controlled motion. Also, the tool has a slicker profile, so it work in situations where pneumatic squeezer does not fit.

Then it all goes to a long deburring process.

HS-00001 doubler have a lot of holes for such a small part!
