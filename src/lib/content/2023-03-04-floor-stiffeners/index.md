Today I drilled two of the floor stiffeners.

<!-- more -->

Nothing too fancy, I clamped the floor stiffeners to the structure, then drilled the two holes on both sides of the stiffener. After that, I drilled all the bottom holes through the bottom skin.

Also, I drilled two out of three holes in the cover support ribs. I couldn't drill the hole closest to the F-704 as it is too close to the bulkhead for my angle drill. I think I will be able to drill that hole if I remove the bottom skin.

For some reason, I did not drill the holes in the firewall angles F-601-J, so I need to locate and drill them now. To do that, I marked how much the stiffener overlaps with the angle and placed the holes. The plans call for an exact 1/4" distance from the edge of the firewall angle. However, I don't like drilling that close to the edge, especially, in a thick material where small tilting of the drill can move the hole. Based on my markings, I have a 5/8" total overlap, so I placed the holes at 5/16" (I also moved the aftmost hole forward by 1/16", to get the same 5/16" edge distance).

Then I drilled the holes in the angles and checked that edge distances look good.

Finally, drilled the holes with my angle drill. First, to #40, then upsized to #30. I actually like how the drill works in thick materials -- it pulls itself into the existing hole. I think it self-aligns much better than reamers do.
