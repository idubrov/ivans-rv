Finally, got my wing kit!

<!-- more -->

The wing kit consists of two crates, one with the skins and the majority of the parts, and the other one with long parts (wing spars, longerons).

The crates:

While I was looking at the crates, I got an e-mail from Van's asking me to confirm I received the notification about the quality issues they had with some parts (aileron nose ribs). Due to missed heat treatment step, these parts cracked during forming. I looked at the parts I got, and turned out they were from the "good" batch (the bad batch is from August/September of 2022, and my parts are from September 2021). The parts looked good, too.

I did some unpacking, moving parts to the shelf. I still need to figure out where to store long parts, the wing spars, and the leading edge skins.

Also, took a quick look at the anodized central section/wing spar parts. They look nice!

Now, what's next? I definitely want to finish the central section of the fuselage, but what after that? Switch to building the wing? Or continue with the fuselage?
