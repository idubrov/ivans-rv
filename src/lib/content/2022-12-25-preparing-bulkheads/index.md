The short session today, preparing sides and bulkheads for riveting.

<!-- more -->

Just a few things. First, I drilled the center section vertical bars F-704G to the bulkhead and countersunk them.

Then I drilled all the holes to the final size (#30), deburred the parts, and re-assembled them with the alignment pins. The next step is to rivet the sides.
