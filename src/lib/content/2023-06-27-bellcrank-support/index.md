A bit of riveting and machining today.

<!-- more -->

First, I riveted the top of the F-728A bellcrank channel to the F-706 bulkhead. I used the squeezer for this task.

Then I riveted the F-728B angle to the channel.

After that -- I machined the spacers on the lathe.

And the result is the bellcrank assembly.

Another small task was to finish the F-757-S plate for the right side. The plates look nasty, I need to re-prime them as they are somewhat visible.

Finally, I drilled and countersinked both forward F-721A and aft F-721B canopy decks.
