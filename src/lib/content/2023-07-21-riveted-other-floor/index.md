Same as yesterday but for the right side.

I screwed the forward floors, which took me about half an hour!

And started working on the F-741A cover support brackets.

Regarding the laser-cut parts, my current assessment is that in my wing kit (which I haven't started working on yet), I have ribs and other parts (tank baffles) laser-cut. The ones that are not "must replace" don't look too bad, but I am waiting for more data to see how to proceed. 

I did not find any laser-cut parts in the fuselage yet. I received my kit in August 2022, and I remember that some parts were from 2021 (before Van's started using the alternative process). However, I did not track each and individual part. The baggage ribs were in blue plastic (which tells me they were punched). The bulkheads are all primed now, but the tooling holes look very round and clean, which tells me they probably were punched. I haven't found any cracks either. 

So, although uncertain, I have a positive outlook on the fuselage. It also should be relatively easy to inspect as many rivets are accessible from the inside. 

Repairing it other than replacing rivets here and there would be quite unrealistic. There is no way the F-705 or the F-706 bulkheads can be replaced without damaging a lot of other parts.

Not sure about my empennage kit. I got it in March 2022, so technically, it could have had laser-cut parts. However since it's all stored on the shelves right now, I am going to inspect it once I get to mounting it to the fuselage.
