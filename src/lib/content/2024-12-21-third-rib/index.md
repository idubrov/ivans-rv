Two and a half hours more, and a third rib.

<!-- more -->

The process I use to rivet the ribs is as follows: 

First, I start the session by scuffing again the skin and cleaning it with naphtha and then acetone. After that, I scuff the rib, clean it, then dimple it.

I put a line of sealant on rib flanges, then smear it with popsicle sticks to create a small "hump" of sealant in the center. Then I carefully lowered the rib and put every single cleco. 

I start riveting from the leading edge, two rivets at a time. I remove two clecoes, remove the excess sealant from the rivet holes, put the rivets, then pick (with the tweezers) whatever sealant they push through the hole from their shop ends. Then, set them normally using the mushroom set and the bucking bar.

I clean the bucking bar and the rivet gun after each two rivets, then move on to the next ones.

Here is me removing the sealant from the rivet.

And the end result.
