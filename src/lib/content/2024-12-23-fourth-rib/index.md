Installed the fourth inner rib today.

The same process as before. However, today I made a mistake while riveting the foremost rivet on the top. I tilted the rivet gun in a wrong way, and left a dent in the leading edge.

Very disappointing, but it should be possible to fill it with the body filler and paint it over.

The rib is fully riveted.
