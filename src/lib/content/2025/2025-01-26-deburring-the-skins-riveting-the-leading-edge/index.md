A bit more work on the weekend.

<!-- more -->

First, I deburred the top skins, to prepare them for priming. Then, I sanded corners of the top skins to create the "scarf joint" where two top skins overlap. I used Roloc discs for rough sanding, then sanding paper on a block to finish.

After that, I installed all the rivets that attached the leading edge to the main spar.
