Over the weekend my son and I finished riveting the top skins.

<!-- more -->

We bucked the rivets the regular way -- with a bucking bar. There are some noticeable indents around the rivets on the top side, the skin is not as smooth as backriveted one, but no issues with the shop ends. On the right wing, where we used backriveting, I had to replace probably around ~40% of the rivets because I did not like the shop ends (they were skewed and as a result did not cover the dimple hole fully).

I remember times when this box was overflowing with AN426AD3-3.5 rivets! Now it's only half full (still a lot of rivets, though!).

Then I riveted aileron brackets to the left wing.

Finally, I made a very simple wing cradle. I changed the design to make it more narrow (2' instead of 3' as per plans), to save some space in my garage. I won't have top skins access, but I cannot think of any reason why would I need to. Maybe I won't have enough "up" aileron travel in this configuration? Time will show.

Also, I ordered the avionics for the wings.
