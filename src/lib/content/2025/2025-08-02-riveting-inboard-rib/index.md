Today I installed the inboard rib.

As usual, not too many photos because I am way too stressed that I don't have enough of the sealant time (I'm still using 2.5oz cartridges), but here is what I got today after the session.

Rib fully riveted to the tank.

Also, I've realized that I haven't prepared the z-brackets yet. Since I wanted to use the whole weekend to finish the fuel tank, I rushed to scuff them and prime them.
