Today I tested the fuel tank.

I found no leaks!

Then, I installed the fuel tank on the wing. I have no gap between the fuel tank and the leading edge skin, which according to VAF is a problem: it creates extra stress in the paint and in the materials due to thermal cycles. I will file it a bit later.
