Finishing the right fuel tank.

<!-- more -->

Wrapping up the fuel tank construction. First, I made a new arm from a 3/32" music wire. It looks close enough to what the original arm was made from.

Installing the fuel sender plate was relatively clean because I used NAS1473A08 sealed nutplates. This way, I only needed to seal a small area inside the screw holes, without the need to seal the screws themselves.

To make the ground connection more reliable for the fuel sender, I added a terminal tab under one of the screws.

Initial tests with the balloon showed no major leaks!
