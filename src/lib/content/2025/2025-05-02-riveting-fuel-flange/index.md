Today I mixed the tank sealant from a can and riveted the fuel flange and the fuel vent.

Nothing too special, just a normal sealant plus riveting operation. 

This is the fuel flange.

And here is the fuel vent. Later, I replaced a couple of rivets as they were not sitting completely flush. My mistake was to use the rivet gun instead of simply squeezing them.
