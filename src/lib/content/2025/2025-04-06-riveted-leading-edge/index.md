Today I permanently installed the leading edge to the main spar.

<!-- more -->

The process was the same as for the right wing -- I put the rivet gun with the double-offset rivet set inside the leading edge, and bucked the regular solid AN470AD4 rivets.

This time it didn't go as smooth as the last time -- the rivets were not bucking very well, and one AN470AD4-5 rivet sheared when I was bucking it.

At least, it was easy to remove the rivet -- the cleanest factory head separation I've ever had on a rivet!

My theory was that my pressure was too low which made rivets to work harden faster than they were bucked, so I bumped pressure a bit. With the help of my son, the rest of the rivets went smoother. I think, my -5 rivets are also "harder" than my -7 rivets -- I shortened one of my -7 rivets to -5 size, and it bucked better. Could a coincidence, however.

The end result is mostly okay.

But one rivet is quite ugly. I had to replace it once already, so I just left it be for now. I think, I will cause more damage if I try to replace it.

Then, as the last step, I squeezed all the rivets attaching the leading edge to the main spar.
