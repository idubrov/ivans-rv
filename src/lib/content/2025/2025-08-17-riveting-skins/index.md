Today I started riveting the top skin for the left wing.

<!-- more -->

Nothing too special, but took me a while. I did aft ("bottom") rivets myself, while laying on the floow. The top rivets I am doing with the help of my sons.

The only notable thing is that based on my experience with the right wing, I used rivets to align the holes first. Start with the main spar holes, then aft spar holes, then put a couple of rivets along the ribs.
