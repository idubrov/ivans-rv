The last step in the fuel tank assembly was to install the fuel sender cover and the sender itself

Nothing too special, I put some sealant on the rib, then screwed in the fuel sender plate.

After that, I "installed" the balloon on the vent line. When I was testing my right tank, my baloon connection was leaking a bit, so this time I put some remaining sealant on the tubing.

This is actually my right fuel tank which I want to re-test (with just the balloon, without spraying it), just to make sure it is still doesn't leak.
