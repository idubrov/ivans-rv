A bit more work on two parts for the left fuel tank: the tank attach angle and the vent line attach clip.

<!-- more -->

Filing the angle to fit the rib.

Smoothing all the edges and drilling the holes for the rivets.

Then, I created a small vent line attachment clip which is used to hold the end of the vent line at the filler cap.

The next step is to scuff the skin, dimple it and start assembling the left tank!
