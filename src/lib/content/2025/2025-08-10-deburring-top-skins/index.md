Back to working on the wings themselves.

<!-- more -->

Today I worked on the top skins: match-drilling them to the structure, then deburring and dimpling the ribs. When I was working on the right wing, because of how floppy the "new" style ribs are, I thought that instead of match-drilling I would simply upsize the holes. However, after giving it some thought, I decided against it, just to avoid issues with poor fit. I still upsized the holes that attach to the spar (because spar was counter-sinked already, and the holes won't provide good support for the reamer), but the rest of the holes I match-drilled as per instructions.

Then there was a long process of deburring everything and preparing a "scarf" join.

Finally, I dimpled the ribs in the structure.

The next step would be to prime the skins.
