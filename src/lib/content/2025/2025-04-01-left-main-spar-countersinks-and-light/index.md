A little more work on the main spar, then cutting the holes for the landing lights.

<!-- more -->

First, I did the rivets that attach main ribs to the main spar underneath the fuel tank skins (the foremost rivets). The countersinks for these rivets are regular "flush"-sized countersinks.

Then I did all the countersinks for the rest of the holes on the main spar -- these are 0.007" deeper-than-flush countersinks.

Then I started working on the landing lights cutout. First, I marked the leading edge using the template from the Duckworks kit, then cut the hole.

Finally, I shaped the plexiglass lens for the cutout.
