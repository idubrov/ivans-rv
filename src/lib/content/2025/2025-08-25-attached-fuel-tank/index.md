Today I attached the right fuel tank to the wing.

<!-- more -->

I don't expect to remove the fuel tank from the wing (well, unless it leaks) so I installed all the fasteners attaching the fuel tank to the wing and torqued them to the specification.

Also, I replaced a number of baffle rivets as many of them were sticking too much (not enough counter-sinking). I think, only small number of them were not up to the spec (up to 0.010" above surface is allowed as per MIL spec), but I replaced many other as well. Some rivets are still sticking a bit, I can probably shave them if I really need to.
