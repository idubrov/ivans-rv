Riveted the third rib, but I ran out of cartdridges with the tank sealant.

<!-- more -->

Aircraft Spruce ran out of 2.5oz cartridges of tank sealant, so I have to wait before I can rivet the rest of the fuel tank.

This is a rare moment where I wasn't afraid to take photos while putting the tank sealant on the rib.

I put a bead along the flange, then form a small ridge at the center using a popsicle stick.
