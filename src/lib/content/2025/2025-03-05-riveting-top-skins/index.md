Over the last few weeks, my son and I were riveting the right wing top skins, little by little.

For the riveting procedure, I went with the backriveting where my son would hold a very heavy bucking bar and I used a double offset back riveting set.

It all looked okay at first, but after carefully inspecting the rivets I didn't like how a lot of them were "skewing" to one side. I will be replacing them using the regular bucking procedure, with my son doing the rivet gun.
