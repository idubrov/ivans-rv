Couple of short sessions over the last few days riveting the left leading edge.

First, I primed the parts of the stall sensor I forgot to prime with the other parts of the leading edg.

Then I riveted the nutplates to the doubler for the stall sensor access panel.

More riveting. Nothing too special, just a normal the rivet gun and the backing work.

The access panel doubler is riveted to the skin.

While I was riveting, I had a string attached to the bucking bar via a 3D-printed sleeve I bought. At one point, I dropped the bar all the way into the leading edge, and the string caught it just before it hit the skin! Simple accessory saves the day.
