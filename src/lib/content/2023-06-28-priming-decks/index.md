Today I primed the F-721A and F-721B canopy decks and the F-14 aft deck, plus a few other parts.

Not much, just this photo.

Also, I started itemizing the wires I will need and building a simple tool to calculate various statistics about the wires and the number and gauges of wires going through each "choke point". So far it seems like I should be fine with the snap bushings as per plans. There are a lot of wires going through the F-704 central section, but it has a snap bushing on both sides, too, so I can reroute some of the wing wires there.
