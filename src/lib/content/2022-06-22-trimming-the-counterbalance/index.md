A short session of trimming the counterweight balance as per plans.

Since I am still waiting to get my double offset back rivet set, I trimmed the counterweight lead. Not much to say here, I marked it with the sharpie, then cut it with the hacksaw. Finally, shaped it with the wooden chisel and the file.

Also, while looking at the electric elevator trim kit, I found that it has two parts, E-617EEPP-1 and E-618EEPP-1, which look very similar to E-717 and E-718 trimmed for the electric trim kit. I asked Van's if I can use them instead of trimming the E-717 / E-718, and they said I can if the holes on the parts match the holes on the trim tab skin. I measured the parts, and they seem to be exactly what I need. This saves me from fabricating the parts, and also I can keep E-717 and E-718 in case I would want to switch to the manual trim (unlikely, but...)
