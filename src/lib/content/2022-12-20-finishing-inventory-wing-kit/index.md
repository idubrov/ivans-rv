Today I finished the inventory of the wing kit.

<!-- more -->

Not much, mostly, going through all the hardware bags and crossing items from the inventory list.

Also, I ordered O-1 drill rods in sizes 7/16" and 1/4". The idea is to use them as locating pins for the central bulkhead assembly. The nice thing about these drill rods is that they come with a ground surface (15 RMS max) and have a tolerance of +-0.0005" (half a thousand). Will see how well it will work, it seems like bolts have a tolerance of +0.000" -0.001" so technically rod could be slightly larger than needed.
