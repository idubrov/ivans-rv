A few more parts are scuffed and primed.

<!-- more -->

Primed fuselage ribs and armrests today. I didn't prime them before because there were way too many parts to prime at once, and I was too eager to start riveting the fuselage.

Same old, scuffed the parts first.

And then sprayed them with primer.
