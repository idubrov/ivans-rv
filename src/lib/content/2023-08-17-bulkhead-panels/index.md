Today I worked a bit on the baggage bulkhead panels F-751 and F-652.

However, the first thing I did was trim the F-749 forward baggage side covers. Nothing too fancy, just used the snips to cut along the line.

The top F-652 bulkhead panel needs to be trimmed. The cut is a simple radius cut, so I made a cardboard template to transfer the radius to the part.

Then I trimmed the panel using the snips.

The cut doesn't have to be precise, all you need is that there is enough edge distance from all the holes that are used to attach the panel to the F-706 bulkhead.

Finally, I drilled the panel.
