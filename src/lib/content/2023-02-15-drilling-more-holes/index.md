Drilled a few more holes.

<!-- more -->

The first thing I did today was to trim the longerons so the skins extend 3/4" past the forward edge of the longeron. I used my thin kerf so to cut the longerons.

Then I clamped and drilled the front parts of the longerons to the skins.

Finally, I drilled the holes that connect the side and the bottom skins together.
