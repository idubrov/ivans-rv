Removed parts of the valve train and cylinder #1.

<!-- more -->

A couple more steps to take apart the engine. First, I removed the rocker arms, the push rods, and the push rod tubes.

Shafts required some tapping to get out. To do that, I used an aluminum drive pin and a long piece of a drill rod that I can put through the pin of the other cylinder.

Then I removed the cylinder #1. I had to grind my wrenches a bit, so they fit better. They still don't get fully on the nuts, so I will either need to grind them more or find better wrenches when I am ready to install new ones.

I saved some money and did not buy the tool to remove the pin, so I need to make one myself, to remove the piston from the connecting rod.

The cylinder on the outside.

The inside looks pretty good to me. Not an expert, but the color looks like a healthy steel color to me (no overheating). I can see the original cross-hatch marks. There are a few flat spots, but that's probably expected for a 2000-hour cylinder?

I am probably going to make some minimal effort to keep them, and possibly throw them away a few years later!
