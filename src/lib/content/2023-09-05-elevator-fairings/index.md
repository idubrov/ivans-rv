Waiting for the resolution of the whole laser-cut parts drama, I started fitting the elevator fairings.

First, I added K1000-4 nutplates to both elevators such that I can add extra counterbalance weight later if needed. As dumb as I am, I countersinked the elevator on the wrong side. The nutplate needs to be inside the fairing, with the weight attached to the inboard side of the counterbalance arm. So I countersinked these holes on the correct side and filled the holes with the NAS1097AD3 rivets, then drilled new holes for the nutplate.

Since I wanted to fiberglass over the counterbalance weights, I rounded them with a file so I could put cloth over the edges. I probably need to round edges a bit more.

Finally, I drilled the holes in the fiberglass fairings, countersinked them, and dimpled the holes in the skins.

Since the holes on the skins are very close to the outboard rib flanges, I made a spacer of the same thickness as these flanges and put it over the holes. This made dimples go through two layers (or three layers in one place) of material, but it worked fine. Of course, I only got that idea after I dimpled a couple of holes and noticed that dimples left marks on the skins due to uneven material thickness.

I ordered my "composite" supplies from Aircraft Spruce, will see how it goes.
