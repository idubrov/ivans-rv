Today I riveted everything together.

<!-- more -->

First, I attached both skins to the skeleton. The instructions called for a bucking bar and a flush mushroom set, which is what I did. It was easier than doing backriveting, perhaps, because I was able to see both sides. Also, mushroom is quite big so I did not have to control it that much.

Then, I used pneumatic squeezer to attach skins to the ribs. Nothing special here, except for the last two rivets on each side. For the second to the last rivets I had to use a yoke with a thin nose, however, for the last two rivets even thin nose wouldn't fit. Instead, I used a [flat steel plate as a driver](1-setting-last-rivet.jpeg) for the rivet. They turned out to be okay, although bar was flexing a bit (I don't think I could have used thicker bar due to spacing). Also, it seems like I scratched ribs a bit -- maybe, I should have covered bar with the painter's tape.

Finally, I used [flat squeezer set](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/products/flat-squeezer-sets) to set the trailing edge. Again, as in my first practice kit, trailing edge rivets set just fine. I did not used any special technique. It seems like some builders set rivets partially with a rivet gun, then finalize with squeezer set or use some other progressive setting technique. I, however, just squeezed them in one setting, to the final size. The trailing edge does have some small amount of waving, but I am not sure if there was anything I could have done differently (maybe, tank sealant or double stick tape, as per real part, would have helped to keep edges really tight):

I noticed, though, that after assembling most of the control surface with rivets, trailing wedge did not fit exactly as it did when I assembled it with clecos -- maybe, due to offset dimples on slightly elongated holes?

Finally, the leading edge. I rolled it using a broomstick and gorilla tape. It kind of worked, but I did not feel like I have full control over the process. The very edge did not roll well, also bend was a bit uneven -- it had a bit of a wave.

Overall, it turned out to be fine. After fiddling with the edges, I was able to make them relatively tight, then set the rivets. For comparison, [this is how my first attempt looks like](5-edges-loose.jpeg). External edge also look okay:

<Mistake blunder /> This was also the moment of my biggest blunder in this project. Just 5 minutes to the end. After I drilled the holes, I have realized that I used #40 drill instead of #30. I started re-drilling the holes, but drill bit was grabbing because the size difference between #40 and #30 is relatively small (also, I used an electric drill since it was relatively late). It is embarrassing to admit, but somehow I got this brilliant idea that finger is a good stop for a drill bit. Well, it sort of is. But I don't recommend it -- too much blood everywhere. And of course it got inside the leading edge where it is hard to remove it... oh well, I'll keep it there as a reminder. Good thing is it is just a #30 hole in the fingertip.

...and that cocludes my practice kit #2!
