A bit of priming work for the fuselage parts.

<!-- more -->

I intend to install the floors, so I primed the forward F-742 floors and the permanent F-750 side covers.

The F-747 baggage floors I have are a bit damaged (I stepped on a couple of clecoes while crawling in), so I ordered new ones. I probably could have straightened the holes but decided to replace the part anyway. They don't really require much preparation, so no labor was wasted.

Then I sprayed them with the primer. I started adding 10% more water to the mix to make it a bit thinner and easier to spray, and I think it works well. It leaves a more finish-like surface, as opposed to a very grainy one.
