Today I fitted the new tail spring mount.

<!-- more -->

I finally got my back-ordered parts, which included the tail spring mount plus the tail spring. It took me quite a while to disassemble these two. For some reason, the holes in the mount are extremely tight. I had to pretty much unscrew the tail spring to get it out.

Then I fitted it to the fuselage. An initial fit after drilling the two holes for the bolts connecting to the F-711.

And then, the final fit, with the shims.

The manual says to put shims on the F-711 part side. However, no matter what I tried to do, it wouldn't fit with the shims on that side. So I opted to put some shims on the F-712 bulkhead side. The bottom of the mount fits perfectly, but there was a gap at the top. I had to stack two shims to make it fit better (no shims at the bottom, one shim in the middle, and two shims at the top). Seems like a good fit.
