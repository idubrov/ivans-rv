Today I riveted the external steps to the fuselage.

<!-- more -->

I chose to use tank sealant between the fuselage and the steps, to protect the fuselage from corrosion and to prevent water from getting in between the steps and the skins.

Some of the tank sealant migrated inside through the rivet holes and created quite a mess! Good thing this area is going to be permanently closed.

This is how it looks from the outside.

The rivet pattern looks a bit funky because of the three original holes [I reused](../2023-02-16-fitting-the-right-external-step) for the AN470AD4 rivets.

Cleaning everything from the tank sealant took another hour to do.
