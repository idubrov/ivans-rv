Today I installed the last inner rib and a fuel vent line.

<!-- more -->

All the same, continue installing the inner ribs. I spend probably less than half of a sealant cartridge. This is the amount that was left after the fifth rib.

And the rib itself.

In addition, I bent the fuel vent line. It goes from the root rib to the fuel cap. It is mostly straight, with an offset section in the first bay.

The next would be to install the outboard rib.
