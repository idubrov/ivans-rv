Spend some time cutting the hole for the landing light.

I am planning to install the FlyLeds landing lights on the leading edges of the wings, so I spent some time preparing the leading edge for the Duckworks leading edge light kit installation.

The first step was to put the template for the cut in the leading edge.

Then I cut through using the nibbler. The hole I got had very rough edges, but I put them far enough from the desired location so I could file the edges to make them smooth.

After using some files and sandpaper, the final hole looks like this.

Then I trimmed the lens. I used a Dremel disc to cut off the edges, then sanded on a belt sander. The Dremel disc did not work very well (it tends to overheat and melt the plastic), but sanding cleared all the issues on the edges.

The next step will be preparing the fuel tank parts.
