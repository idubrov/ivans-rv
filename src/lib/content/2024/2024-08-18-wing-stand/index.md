I spent some time working on a wing stand.

<!-- more -->

The plans call for a stand that goes all the way to the ceiling, but since I am building in apartments, I cannot do that. Instead, I made two separate stands attached to plywood that works as a base.

Somehow took me about 4 hours to make it, and this is what it looks like in the end. I made the stands for both wings so I could work on them at the same time.

They are not super-stable, but I hope that with the weight of the wing, they will be good enough. Any misalignment could be adjusted via the threaded rods that support the main spar.

The threaded rods could be adjusted by moving the nuts up and down.

They are not fully complete yet, I still need to do the support for the rear spar, but I will do that once I cleco the rear spar so I know where to put the supports.

Also, I got a reply from the Builder's support about my wing ribs, and it wasn't much more than a list of educational materials. A bit disappointing, I was hoping for a bit more specific guidance. I think I will replace the worst 3 ribs. The rest seem to be fine.
