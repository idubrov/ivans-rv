Today I installed the inboard rib which concluded the rib installation.

I also bent the arm of the fuel sender for the correct operation. Unfortunately, I did not understand the instructions well and ruined one arm. For now, I took the arm from the other sender, but I also ordered some 3/32" music wire to try to make a new arm. Will see if that wire will work, and if not, I will have to order a whole new sender.
