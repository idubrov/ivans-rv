Today I started riveting the ribs to the skin.

Again, I followed the [Van's RV Fuel Tank Construction Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTl827JWz68) video. I was working alone, so I did not take many photos.

Since some of the rivets (the forward ones) are kind of hard to reach, I used my swiveling mushroom set. It kind of worked, but I found that it does not squeeze rivets all too well, and gun tends to slide away (because of the swivel). For the next rib, I will try to use my regular mushroom set.

This was the end result.

It took me about 2 hours of time to install a single rivet. Since I still had sealant left, I used it to close the tooling hole on the outboard rib. I used AN470A6 rivet, a soft one, as the structural strength is not important for that application, and it is much easier to set the soft rivet.

Finally, I riveted the anti-rotation bracket, too.

And that was the end of the session. I had to discard probably the majority of the sealant cartridge, but it's so convenient, so I'll keep using them.
