Just a lot of drilling today.

<!-- more -->

Since I am planning for the electronic fuel injection, I am considering my options for where to put the return line. So far, I identified 3 possible locations.

Then I cut the stock for the attachment T-405 attach angle. Miter saw with a regular wooden blade cuts through aluminum just fine (but still need to be very careful)!

Then there was a lot of drilling. I match-drilled all the ribs to the skin.

Finally, I counter-sinked the holes that are used to attach the baffle. These holes are not dimpled to make baffle installation easier.
