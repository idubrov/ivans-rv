Today I continued working on the leading edge -- primed the parts.

Most of the work session today was spent priming the parts.

However, after shooting the primer I also did some follow-up tasks like dimpling all the holes and riveting the nutplates to the joint plate. And yes, I missed one of the nutplates rivets, I fixed that later.

I did not dimple the trailing edge rivet holes because my main spar is not countersunk for these holes. I cannot easily countersink the top line of rivets because I still have the top skin riveted to the structure. Once I am ready to assemble everything together, I will remove the top skin and then countersink all the holes.
