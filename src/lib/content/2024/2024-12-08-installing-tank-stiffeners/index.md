The day has come to mix some sealant and start assembling the right fuel tank!

<!-- more -->

The first thing was to clean the skin. I washed it first, then scuffed the mating areas, and cleaned them with naphtha until the towels would not pick up any dirt. Finally, just before the assembly, I wiped them with acetone.

I did not take a lot of photos, most of them I took only after I finished the work. It wasn't a particularly dirty process, but I had to wipe and clean everything all the time to keep the sealant in check.

I started by preparing some supplies. Some towels for wiping, paper strips to clean the rivet holes, popsicle sticks, and some Q-tips (I can soak them with acetone and do some targeted cleaning).

Also, I put some rivets in naphtha to clean them from whatever oil they might have on them. I scuffed the stiffeners and wiped them clean also.

After that, there were 4 hours of riveting all the stiffeners, the fuel flange, and the fuel drain flange. I pretty much followed the [Van's RV Fuel Tank Construction Tips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTl827JWz68) video.

This is what the end result looks like, the stiffeners.

After riveting everything together, I worked a little bit on fabricating an anti-rotation bracket for the return fuel line. The idea of the bracket is to lock the AN832-6D fitting so it cannot rotate when the return line is tightened or removed.

I started by doing some calculations based on the AN924-6D nut size.

This is what the prototype looks like.

The actual part is made from a 0.125"-thick plate of aluminum.

Somehow I managed to miscalculate the part a few times, but in the end, I got two brackets. One of them is a bit on the loose side, but it still would not allow union fitting to rotate, so it should be fine.

After drilling the holes, I realized that these holes were too close to the AN 6D spacer, so I could not put universal AN470AD4 rivets. After giving it some thought, I solved that problem by dimpling the rib, countersinking the brackets, and using AN426AD4 rivets with flush heads on the outside.
