Just various smaller things over the last few days.

<!-- more -->

First, I drilled the F-7114 fuselage gussets. They are installed instead of the gear mounts of the tricycle gear. It was nothing too special, just putting the gussets in place, fastening the wing bolts temporarily, and then drilling the gussets to the fuselage.

Then I fixed my air compressor and primed the horizontal stabilizer fairings and the new parts for the aileron hinge bracket.

Finally, I installed the horizontal stabilizer fairings and removed the empennage.
