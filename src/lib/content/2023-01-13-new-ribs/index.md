Deburred the crotch strap brackets and drilled the new ribs.

<!-- more -->

I don't know how did it take me 4 hours (maybe, I was meditating over the parts too much?), but all I did today was deburring the crotch strap brackets and then drill the new F-715 seat ribs. New ribs fit the skins better, I think.

The assembly looks disgusting with all the fingerprints. Really waiting for the moment I can scuff and prime the floors.
