Today I did some repairing of the rib flanges.

<!-- more -->

I found a few other ribs which were marginal in terms of rib separation from the bulkhead, so I drilled all these rivets and reset them.

I used a combination of back-riveting and standard bucking procedures. There was one rivet that was a pain to get to, the top one in the center ribs. Since it required a lot of bending of the ribs to get to it, the flange was not nearly as tight as it should be.

I made a washer from a piece of lead that was left from the left elevator and used it for pushing the parts together.

It worked well, the flange is tight now.
