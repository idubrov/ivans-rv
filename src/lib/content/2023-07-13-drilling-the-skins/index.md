Reamed all the holes between the top skins and the bulkheads.

I reamed all the holes in the aft top skins.

The hole that I suspected will be off was elongated, so I upsized it to a -4 rivet. I only upsized the bulkhead hole. I will upsize holes in the skins later when I get to riveting the skins. For symmetry, I upsized the hole on the opposite side, too, even though it was not needed.

There are a few other holes that I might need to upsize to NAS1241 rivets.

I also rerouted the rudder cables using the SB625-7 bushings, with SB437-4 used as sacrificial inserts. I found that SB625-8 bushings don't have an inner rim for SB500-4 to grab onto. They still can snap in certain positions, but seems like the combination of SB625-7 plus SB437-4 is a better fit.
