A short session of cleaning everything and shooting the primer.

<!-- more -->

Same procedure as before: clean everything with the EkoClean, etch with the EkoEtch, then prime with the EkoPoxy.

There were some corrosion spots on the outer side of the skin. I think the paint drop cloth I use while etching absorbed too much of the etcher, so placing parts on it makes these parts to be etched from the opposite side. Not a big issue as all exterior skins will be eventually scuffed for the painting.
