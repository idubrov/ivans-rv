A short session of cleaning everything and shooting the primer.

<!-- more -->

Same procedure as before: clean everything with the EkoClean, etch with the EkoEtch, then prime with the EkoPoxy.

Initially, I did not want to deburr holes in the skins because they are so thin. Since I used a reamer to open the holes, I thought I would not get a lot of burrs. On the primed side, I removed all burrs when I scuffed the skins during the etching process. However, later I used a drill bit (rotate it between fingers) to remove small burrs from the holes on the skins.

There were some corrosion spots on the outer side of the skin. I think the paint drop cloth I use while etching absorbed too much of the etcher, so placing parts on it makes these parts to be etched from the opposite side. Not a big issue as all exterior skins will be eventually scuffed for the painting.
