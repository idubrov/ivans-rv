I got the ribs about a month ago, but I was busy with some vacation time and some other DIY projects.

Here are the new ribs on the shelf:

The first step I have been doing over the last two weeks was to adjust the flanges using the fluting tool and a [flange adjustment tool](http://www.rv7-factory.com/?p=1096).

After a few hours of work (it takes me probably about 15 minutes to adjust a single rib!), I got this pile of forward ribs.

There is still much work to deburr them, which would be my next step.

Also, I got my Andair FS2020 fuel valve (this is the one with return lines)!
