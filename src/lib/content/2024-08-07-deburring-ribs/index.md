There was another pause due to vacation time and some other DIY projects, and now back to deburring of the ribs. 

<!-- more -->

Nothing too fancy, just slowly going through the ribs. However, I have a bit of an issue with the nose ribs. I smoothed them to remove the "faceting", and then later realized that this caused a knife-edging in some of the flanges.

Here is what the worst case looks like (after some additional deburring to remove the knife edge):

Also, when I checked the rib against the skin, it turned out that the nose part of the rib didn't even touch the skin! So, I don't think I needed to do that smoothing at all.

I asked builders support what to do, but for now, I will continue with the rest of the ribs.
