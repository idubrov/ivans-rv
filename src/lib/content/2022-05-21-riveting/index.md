Time to rivet the horizontal stabilizer together!

<!-- more -->

Now since all parts are primed, it is time to assemble the horizontal stabilizer. 

The first thing I have done is I riveted the front spar assembly, by attaching two ribs (each side) to it. Those rivets were difficult to approach with the squeezer, but this new manual squeezer I got worked perfectly fine.

One of the tool sites says that pneumatic squeezer is strictly better than the hand one. I don't agree with that. There are several aspects where I found hand squeezer has a bit of an edge against the pneumatic one. And by hand squeezer I mean [Main Squeeze](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/products/main-squeeze-model-22) from Cleaveland Tools. I don't know if other hand squeezers are in any way similar to it or not (in terms of size, operation, and so on).

First, the huge advantage of the manual squeezer is that you can position it more accurately before you apply any pressure. It is more controllable. In some spots, you cannot fit the squeezer until you squeeze it just a little. With the pneumatic squeezer, I found two options: feathering the trigger, so it pushes the bottom anvil but does not really apply any force or to remove the return spring and extend it manually.

Both ways don't work too well. Feathering works until you accidentally press a bit too much, and the squeezer crushes whatever parts are in its way. Unforgivable power. Removing the spring sort of works, but it is too easy to push it back and then you need to manually extend it again.

Second advantage of the manual squeezer is that it is actually a bit smaller in some dimensions: pneumatic one I have is very fat. Main Squeeze, on the other hand, is quite thin.

The force required to set -4 rivets is relatively small with the Main Squeeze, so when you need to set a few of very important rivets, you don't really get tired. Most of the time spent for the setup, and not for the riveting itself.

Where pneumatic squeezer shines is when you have 100 easy holes / rivets, and you need to dimple or put rivets through them.

Here is me posing how I squeeze some rivets which were impossible to reach with my pneumatic squeezer:

Sure, I could have used my rivet gun, possibly with double offset set ðŸ˜›

Before I started riveting the skin, I checked my ribs and found that their flanges were out of square again:

So I fixed them with my wooden block.
