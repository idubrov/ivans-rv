Life is getting in a way a bit, so progress is slow. A few more lines of rivets are set.

The second spanwise line of the rivets of the F-704 bulkhead is set.

Plus, some lines of rivets on the front side skins.

Still, took me about 2 hours. Mostly, because all the side rivets I was doing by myself, and it takes about three times longer.
