Today was a deburring day. 

<!-- more -->

Spent all the time deburring the bulkheads. I used 320 grit sandpaper, small [sanding pencils](https://aircraft-tool.com/shop/detail.aspx?id=12302), and a round file for deburring the gaps between the flange tabs. The majority of the edges of the parts were already deburred with the Scotch-Brite wheel.

Now the parts are ready for scuffing with PreKote and priming.
