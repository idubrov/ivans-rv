Since I will need to prime all of the parts, I built a paint booth.

<!-- more -->

The construction is simply a skeleton from 1-1/4" PVC pipes with some clear plastic on top of it. I used [these instructions](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Paint-Booth-in-Your-Garage) to build it.

This is how it started, all the components.

Then after about one hour, everything is assembled.

Since I am now working on a very few parts and primer I chose is less toxic, I am going to try it without the exhaust fan.
