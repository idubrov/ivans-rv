Did a small amount of work to finish the seat stop plate.

Today I went to Harbor Freight to buy a bending brake so I can bend the F-705K plate.

The brake is, of course, of Harbor Freight quality: it is not exactly flat. However, it did work and I got my parts bent as needed (4Ëš).

Also, I bought some AN345 nuts (plain hex nuts) from the Aircraft Spruce and painted them red with the paint from the Home Depot. The idea behind this I would use these nuts as temporary fasteners and the red color should identify them as "temporary".
