Today I installed the nutplates and dimpled the skin and the ribs.

First, I assembled small removable sections from the access (center) seat ribs. The plans call for flush rivets, but I put universal ones instead, the same size (I purchased them separately, as Van's RV-7 kit does not include AN470AD3 rivets).
