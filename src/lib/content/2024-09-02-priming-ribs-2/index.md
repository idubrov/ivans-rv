Another Sunday priming day -- working on the second set of wing ribs.

<!-- more -->

Another priming session, this time I did W-712 and W-710 wing ribs.

The reason I chose them over W-00711-L/R-1 is that it seems there is another drama unfolding with the ribs!

This time, the manufacturing issue was underpressed stiffeners on some of the ribs. Here are two ribs, the "old" LCP-impacted W-711 rib (on the left) and the new replacement W-00711 rib (on the right). It's a bit hard to see what's happening, but the new rib doesn't have its stiffener "bars" formed nearly as much as the other rib.

The issue has been noted by other builders on Facebook, and now there is a VAF discussion happening as well. I asked Builder's support what I should be doing about it.

Here is a video of me flexing the new and the old parts. The new one seems to be way more flimsy, due to inferior stiffeners.
