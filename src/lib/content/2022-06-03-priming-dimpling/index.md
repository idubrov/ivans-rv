The next day, after primer has dried, dimpling time.

<!-- more -->

I dimpled all the stiffeners using a narrow female dimple die (to avoid damaging the flange with the standard dimple die, which is wider).

Then I constructed a contraption to mount DRDT-2 between two tables (I clamped two pieces of 2x4 between the table legs). I don't want to construct a table around DRDT-2 since I don't have much space to store it, and for the rudder skins this contraption worked just fine. Will see if I need to improve it for the bigger skins. One issue I have with it is that I cannot push DRDT-2 far back because it will not be supported by 2x4 "joists". Maybe, I'll make a narrow piece of plywood to put on these "joists" so I can position DRDT-2 differently.

Dimpled the right side skin.
