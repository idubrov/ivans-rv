The same bend as yesterday, but for the right skin.

<!-- more -->

The same process as yesterday: bending the aft lower part of the side skins. This is the first part of the process, with the wooden block.

I don't see any cracking!

Then I fluted and clecoed the armrests. I did not drill them as I want to drill them together with the F-704K part, and it was too late to deburr them. Or maybe I'll just leave these two holes until much later.

Finally, I put clamps to hold the right longeron in place. I only have 12 small clamps, and I used 10 of them, so I think I will do one longeron at a time.
