The same, but for the left gusset.

<!-- more -->

When I drilled the right gusset, I drilled based on the edge distances, using the plans as guidance on where to place the hole. For the left one, I started with the aft hole, but this time, I drilled the hole in the gusset first. I located the hole 2D distance from the edges and drilled it. Then I drilled the hole in the auxiliary longeron and clecoed the gusset.

After that, I rotated the gusset (filing it as necessary) so it got a good overlap with the firewall angle and made sure the foremost hole has a good edge distance as well.

Then I marked the overlap on the bracket and placed the holes such that they get maximum edge distance both on the bracket and on the firewall, with the top and the bottom holes located 5/32" from the closest edge (bracket for the bottom hole and the firewall angle top edge for the top hole). I used my rivet spacer to place the remaining three holes (I used the same process with the right gusset, but I located the top hole 1/4" from the firewall edge instead of 5/32").

I clecoed the bracket, pulled the skin, and used the angle drill to drill the holes in the firewall angle.

In the end, the left gusset turned out a bit better than the right one. The edge distances on the firewall rivets are a bit better. I think I did not rotate the right gusset enough (around the aft rivet).

And to finish the day, I started working on the F-902 bulkhead. I upsized the hole for the rudder cable bushings and filed a notch in the flange so the rudder cables do not rub.
