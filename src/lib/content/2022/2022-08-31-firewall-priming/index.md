Finally, I got to do the priming of the firewall parts.

First, I cleaned the parts.

This time I used PreKote instead of EkoEtch from Stewart Systems. I don't like etcher since it is a little bit corrosive. If I spray it on parts awaiting cleaning, they might get some corrosion spots. Also, it requires setting a timer so I rinse it after about 3 minutes. With PreKote I can leave parts covered with it as long as I need (but it should not be allowed to dry on the surface).
