Today I started working on the firewall bulkhead.

Not much to say here. I took the parts that make the firewall bulkhead, deburred, and clecoed them together.

Then I fabricated the angles from a thick aluminum angle stock. I cut the stock with the hacksaw, then brought them to dimensions with the file.

The two other fabricated parts are the stiffener (made from an aluminum angle) and the brake hoses reinforcement plate.
