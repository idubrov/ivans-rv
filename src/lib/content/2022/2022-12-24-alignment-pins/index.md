The project for today was the wing alignment pins.

<!-- more -->

The manual says to use close tolerance bolts, however, the wisdom is to keep them until the moment wings are permanently attached to the airframe. Therefore, I made 16 pins (8 of 7/16" and 8 of 1/4") for alignment/assembly purposes.

I started with the blanks made from O-1 tool steel. The nice thing about O-1 is that you can buy it as drill rods which have a ground surface and also a tolerance of +-0.0005" (half a thousand of an inch). Perfect candidate for the pins.

Then I machined the pin in the lathe. I put a small taper on both sides (~4Â° degree) of all pins.

I did not use any lubricant while machining (to make cleanup easier). Even without coolant/lubricant, the surface finish on the taper was good enough. However, probably, because of that my insert did not last long.

And the final product.

Not sure if I really need all 16 pins, but I thought that I can use them for keeping everything in perfect alignment while assembling the fuselage.

The only oversight was that I made pins ~3-5/8" long, which is a bit on the short side. If my calculations are correct, the thickness of both sections plus the wing spars is 3-1/8" or about that. The untapered sections of some of the pins turned out to be shorter than that. I think this is still good enough as the center bars are pretty thick.

It worked well. I used a soft mallet to drive the pins and put all 16 of them in the aft section. I checked the holes in the center section bars, and they all look good: no scratches, nothing. Some pins are loose (they won't fall due to gravity, but very little force is required to move them). I can move all the pins with my hands, except for one tight hole.
