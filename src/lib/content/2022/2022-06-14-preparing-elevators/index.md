Today I prepared a couple of pieces for the elevators.

First, I separated the reinforcement plates from a single blank, then deburred them.

Then I attached the plates to the spars and reamed all the holes.

After that, I switched back to the skins and the stiffeners. I deburred the remaining stiffeners and clecoed them to the skins.

Then I drilled the holes and removed the vinyl from the skins.

The skins and the parts are now waiting to be deburred and primed.
