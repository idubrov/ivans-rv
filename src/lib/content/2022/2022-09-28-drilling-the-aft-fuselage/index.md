Today I drilled rudder cable fairings to the fuselage and drilled the fuselage holes.

The first thing I did today was to drill the rudder cable fairings to the fuselage skins. I could have fabricated one myself, but instead, I bought them on Aircraft Spruce.

I fit them over the rudder cable to find the location they fit the best, then match-drilled #41 holes with the fuselage.

Finally, I drilled every single hole in the aft fuselage (except for the longeron holes and the holes of the F-706 bulkhead)
