Finished deburring all the center section parts.

Same deal as the last few days: deburring everything.

Also, got my replacement baggage ribs. I found what was the issue: baggage ribs look straight, but they are not. Due to a small curvature of the bottom skin, the bottom flange is curved as well, which causes a bend in the orthogonal dimension. As a result, baggage ribs require some amount of fluting, too.

I fluted the edge ribs, and now they fit perfectly. I also fluted other ribs just a tiny bit. Even though they are drilled already, it helped to reduce the amount of forcing when clecoing them.
