Today I cut the elevators stiffeners from their blanks.

A short session before I went to sleep. I used the snips to cut individual stiffeners. The -J, -K and -L variants are shortened from the -D, -E and -F. I don't fully understand how they fit into the skins (is stiffener spacing different on the left elevator?), so I am not shortening them yet. I am going to deburr all of them on a Scotch-Brite wheel (so they don't scratch the skins), fit them into the skins and see why -J, -K and -L require shortening.
