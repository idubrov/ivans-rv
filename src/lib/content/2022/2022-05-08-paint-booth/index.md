Since I will need to prime all of the parts, I built a paint booth.

<!-- more -->

The construction is simply a skeleton from 1-1/4" PVC pipes with some clear plastic on top of it. I used [these instructions](https://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Paint-Booth-in-Your-Garage) to build it.

This is how it started, all the components.

Then after about one hour, everything is assembled.

Next thing is to cover everything with a plastic sheet. Since I am now working on a very few parts and the primer I chose is less toxic, I am going to try it without the exhaust fan. Also, I am not trying to seal every single hole.

The paint booth was complete, and I exercised spraying latex paint diluted to a 25 seconds viscosity test (as it was recommended somewhere).

I also tried my [primer pistol](https://www.aircraft-tool.com/shop/detail.aspx?id=SA-PP01), but I did not get good results from it. There is [a piece of advice](https://vansairforce.net/community/showpost.php?p=1128843&postcount=11) on Van's Air Force website on how to fix it, but I did not get great results just yet. Initially, I was not able to get any spray at all. After some tinkering, I can get it to spray at 60 PSI, but this pressure is a bit too much.

The next step is to finally prime it!
