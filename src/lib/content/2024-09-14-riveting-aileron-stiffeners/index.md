Today I riveted the aileron stiffeners to the skins.

The procedure is pretty much the same as for the elevators: use back-riveting. I was only able to get good, consistent results if I was looking at the rivet gun from the side. For some reason, if I was looking down at the skin, I was getting too many "smeared" rivets, even though I was holding the tip of the back-riveting set. I am not sure why, maybe, I was applying too much pressure or the gun wasn't fully perpendicular. Or maybe I just was a bit rusty.

Either way, I back-riveted all the rivets except the trailing ones.

Remembering my elevators build experience, I chose to use a bucking bar for the trailing rivet. Back-riveting these rivets is possible but requires some help in opening the skins to get access.

It worked well, but my rivet gun slipped on the last rivet and left a ding in the skin. I removed the stiffener, straightened the skin as much as I could, and put the stiffener back.

The ding is still there, but it is relatively small. I think I'll be able to fill it before painting.

Finally, I used the tool I had made when I bent the trailing edges of the elevators to do the same for the ailerons.
