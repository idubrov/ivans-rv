Mostly finished riveting aft fuselage.

<!-- more -->

I drafted my wife to help me with riveting the bottom rows of the rivets on the aft fuselage. Choosing between different techniques, I chose to do back riveting since it does not require much training. All I needed from the helper is to push the rivet with a heavy back riveting bucking bar.

The back riveting bucking bar is just a big round bucking bar.

It worked well! Most of the rivets turned out okay. Few had shop heads slanted to one side just a bit, but not too much and I kept them. Few rivets I had to drill out and reset, either due to a misaligned rivet gun or because parts were not pushed enough together.

This is the result of one of the bottom rows.

This is me pretending I am riveting. Obviously, fake, as you cannot back rivet without somebody holding the backing plate! However, at least I have proof it was me building the plane -- since I had somebody to take a photo of me!

This is what shop heads look like.

Finally, I riveted the ELT brackets with the LP4-3 rivets. The plan to rivet the brackets using the solid rivets on the bottom worked out great.
