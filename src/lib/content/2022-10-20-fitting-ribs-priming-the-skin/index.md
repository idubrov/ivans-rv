Fitted the baggage ribs and started preparing parts for priming.

First, I drilled the outer baggage ribs to the skin. This time everything went smoothly.

Then I drilled the holes for the external steps.

I used a hole saw from the Home Depot.

It's not a precision tool, but it worked surprisingly well. The only issue was that my milling machine does not have high torque at low RPMs, so I had to run it a bit faster than I wanted. It cuts fine at higher RPMs, but I got less control over what's happening. However, it turned out that the hole saw self-centers itself in the hole, so I didn't really need a lot of control over it.

Finally, I scuffed and primed the bottom skin.
