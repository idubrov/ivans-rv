More fairing work, this time it is a vertical stabilizer!  

<!-- more -->

All the same steps so far. I don't have the epoxy for the micro part so I keep advancing all the fairings to the same stage.

First, the reinforcing aluminum strips are glued inside the fairing. After that -- the end cap is glued temporarily with CA glue.

Then end cap is reinforced with fiberglass cloth.

This is what it lookes like clecoed to the vertical stabilizer.

After that, I sanded the aft of the bottom rudder faring, the area where I reshaped it.

And drilled it to the rudder.
