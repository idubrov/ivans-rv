Started working on the fuel tank parts.

<!-- more -->

I planned to work on the fuel tank, so I started deburring the fuel tank brackets.

Then I clecoed the tank skin to make sure it matches the leading edge well. The instructions said to drill the holes in the joint plate strip, but my kit comes with pre-punched holes. The fit looked good.

Then I prepared the fuel tank stiffeners. They are similar to stiffeners used in the rudder, the elevators, and the ailerons.

While preparing the parts, I realized that I wouldn't have enough clecoes for the fuel tank -- because I used many of them for the leading edge assembly. Since new ribs are less rigid compared to the old ones, I put clecoes into every single hole, which used a lot of clecoes.

I checked the instructions, and it looks like nothing stops me from riveting the leading edge together, and then working on the fuel tank (well, I could have just disassembled it, but might as well...). So, I deburred all the parts of the leading edge as well.
