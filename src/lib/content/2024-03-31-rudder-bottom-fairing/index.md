A bit more work on fairings.

<!-- more -->

Over the last few days, I worked on a rudder bottom fairing. I didn't take many pictures, but here is what I did: covered it with epoxy with micro, sanded, covered with the clear thin epoxy, sanded again, then spray primed.

This is the fairing after the clear epoxy.

After spraying the primer. There are a few pinholes still. I think I didn't apply enough of the micro balloons / clear epoxy so when I sanded, I sanded back to the base material. That's okay, this primer coat is just a temporary measure until I am ready to paint the whole airplane.
