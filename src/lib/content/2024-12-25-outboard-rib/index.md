I worked a bit more on the fuel tank, installing the outboard rib.

<!-- more -->

Nothing too different from before, except that the outboard rib does not require sealing from both sides, and can be sealed just from the inside with a nice filet.

Since I had some sealant pot time left, I worked on riveting the reinforcement ring to the inboard rib.

I used NAS1473A08 nutplates, which are sealed nutplates. The idea is to avoid sealant on the screws themselves so it's easier to remove them later, if needed. They have some rubber that are supposed to seal them, but I used some fuel tank sealant to make sure there are no leaks along the rivets.

Later I found that few rivets were a bit too proud, so I had to remove them and reinstall them.
