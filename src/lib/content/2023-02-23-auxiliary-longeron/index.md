Drilled one of the two auxiliary longerons to the skin.

The F-713 auxiliary longeron needs to be shortened so it fits between the firewall and the F-704 bulkhead. Marking the longeron.

Then I drilled it to the skin. The hole in the middle that is on an intersection of two rivet lines in the skin is probably the most critical to the edge distance issues as an AN3 bolt will go through it. So I marked that hole first, center-punched it, and drilled it on the workbench, keeping it centered as much as I could.

The drilled longeron. I did not drill the holes that go into the engine mounts just yet.

The backside.

Then I drilled both of the seat ribs to the skins.

Finally, I ran the #40 reamer through most of the holes in the fuselage (longeron holes, holes that connect side and aft skins, etc). Took me quite a while!
