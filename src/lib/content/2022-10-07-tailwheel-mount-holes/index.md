Today I made a relief hole for the tailwheel mount.

First, I traced the relief hole from the plans to the aft bottom skin.

Then I made a cut-out and used files to smooth the edges. The hole is slightly less than the template, just in case. Once I get an actual part, I will adjust the fit. I also drilled the hole for the socket. I didn't find the size in the plans, but RV-14 plans show 3/4", so that's what I did.
