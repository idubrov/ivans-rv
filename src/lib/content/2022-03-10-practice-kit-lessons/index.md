Lessons learned from my previous attempt at building a practice kit.

<!-- more -->

This [practice kit from Vans Aircraft](https://store.vansaircraft.com/rv-control-surface-training-project-rv-training-project-1.html) would be my second kit to build. The first one turned out to be okay, but definitely not airworthy.

Here are some of the mistakes I made that I will try to avoid on my next attempt:

- While drilling the trailing edge wedge, I did not clamp it enough, and it moved during the drilling. I only noticed it in the end. I decided to continue the build, with an understanding that if it was a real part, it should have gone into the scrap bin. Not sure what my approach would be in the future. Thin sticky tape of some sort?

  Contributing factor was that I did not use center punch before the drilling. When using thin aluminum as a template (for example, pre-punched holes in a skin), it works okay if drilling perpendicular to the skin through other relatively thin aluminum parts. However, with trailing edge, you drill at an angle into a relatively thick piece of aluminum so drill bit has tendency to wander away. Next time I will try to use a center punch.

  In the end, final holes were horrendous. Few of them were really elongated because of drill bit movement. Surprisingly, rivets still did squeeze okay (I used [a flat squeezer set](https://www.cleavelandtool.com/products/flat-squeezer-sets) from Cleaveland Aircraft Tool).

- While dimpling with the pneumatic squeezer, I accidentally punched an extra hole in the rib flange. The reason was that due to a very tight spacing, I was not able to align male punch guide into the hole. Instead, I was relying on my ability to bring dies together slowly by slowly advancing the trigger. It worked few times, but then one time it didn't, I squeezed the trigger too hard and it poked an extra hole. Next time I will use my custom-made [dimpling bucking bar](0-dimpling-bucking-bar.jpeg) which worked fine for the tightest rivet (two rivets on the rib which are closest to the trailing edge).
- Pull rivets (AD-41-ABS) on the leading edge did not set properly. The leading edge rolled okay (to my assessment), but skins were not tight to one another when I pulled the rivet. I hoped that pulling the rivet would bring both skins together, but this did not happen. I don't know if this is normal and I should have clamped skins tight or I am not using my pull riveter correctly (I mean... It seems like it should be hard to use it incorrectly, but maybe I was applying side pressure which caused rivet stem to break prematurely?). I might get a cheap pneumatic pull riveter.

- Trailing edge wedge interfered with the stiffeners (perhaps, wedge moved inside a bit).

After I finished the first kit, I ordered three more. The reasoning was that it would provide me something to work on while I am waiting for the empennage kit. My plan is to build a second kit to the "airworthy" standard (no serious blunders), using spare kit for parts, if necessary. Then, once I get closer to the empennage build, I plan to build yet another practice kit, but this time, I will do all the priming the way I want to do it for the real project.
