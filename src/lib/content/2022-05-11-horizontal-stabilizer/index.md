Started working on the horizontal stabilizer

<!-- more -->


scotch-brite and file


Then I drilled #21 holes for the main rib. This did not go exactly as planned. I used my electric drill (to avoid making too much noise), which runs relatively slow (2000 rpm?). It grabbed and the drill bit got stuck in the hole. I tried a bigger drill -- same result, same jagged edges of the hole. Tried my air drill -- well, it got stuck, too. Finally, I was able to drill the holes by using my air drill and advancing it _extremely_ slowly.

This was a bit unexpected -- I am used to that when I machine aluminum I can push a #21 drill bit with not much drama, on very low RPMs. The difference, though, is when I machine my part is clamped and my spindle is more powerful than the hand helf drill. Also, I usually work with 6061-T6 aluminum, which is softer.
