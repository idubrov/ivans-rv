In the last few days, I primed the skins and some of the parts that are needed to install the skins.

Lot of work, but not too much to show.

First, I scuffed and primed the skins.

The primer on the skins shows a bit of an orange peel. I did not dilute the primer when I primed the skins, so I think it was a bit too thick.

Then I primed some parts and the left longeron. This time I added some extra water to the primer, and the finish came out smoother.

Finally, I clecoed the left skin, hopefully, for the last time.
