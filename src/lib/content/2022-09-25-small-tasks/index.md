Today I did a few smaller tasks.

<!-- more -->

First, I drilled the holes for the two additional stiffeners in the tailcone area ([Service Letter 00014](https://www.vansaircraft.com/service-information-and-revisions/sl-00014/)).

Interestingly, my paper plans were an older version without these stiffeners. However, my kit did include the parts needed to comply with the service letter.

Then I worked a bit on the cover plates and the corresponding locations for the nut plates.

I drilled and dimpled the cover plates.

Then drilled, dimpled, and countersunk the skins (the countersinks are for the NAS1097 "oops" rivets).

Finally, I worked a bit on the elevator pushrod (just because). I used the rivet fan and the painter's tape to place the holes. I put the centers of the 1st and the 9th holes against the edges of the tape (which gave me 8 holes total), then moved the rivet fan a bit and marked the holes on the tape. Then I measured .250" from the edge of the tape.

Put the tape on the tube.

Finally, drilled the holes with the #41 drill bit first, then the #31 drill bit, then the #30 reamer (for a MSP-42 pull rivet).
