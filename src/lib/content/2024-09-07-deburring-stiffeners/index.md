While waiting for the situation with ribs to resolve, I switched to ailerons.

<!-- more -->

The first step was to prepare the stiffeners: trim them to size, deburr, and, eventually, prime. They come as long aluminum blanks that need to be cut to size with the snips:

The stiffeners after deburring:

The whole stack of them!

In the past, I had issues priming small parts because they tend to fly around when sprayed with the paint gun. This time I want to try some 3D-printed holders designed to keep them in place. Also, it should make it easier to spray many of them at once.

[This is the design](/STLs/PrimeStiffenerHolder.stl) I came with, will see if it works.
