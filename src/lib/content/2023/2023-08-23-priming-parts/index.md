Today I primed the various parts, including the SB-00036 parts.

Cleaning and scuffing the parts. The parts are the flaps actuator parts, the central tunnel cover parts, and the SB-00036 parts.

Then I shot the primer. Interestingly, the primer part A was flowing really well this time. Usually, I have trouble getting it out of my paint pail, but this time it was flowing like water. I wonder if it has to do with the temperature, though, I store the primer in an air-conditioned room.

Also, I quickly installed the OP-60 ADAHRS brackets.
