Got home from my business trip to CA, so back to building!

The first order of business was to replace one of the seat ribs (again!). There was one hole where I did not like the edge distance, so I decided to replace it. The replacement looks good, I am happy with the edge distances. Took me several hours to make progress on this part as fitting requires clecoing and un-clecoing the floors.

Then I connected the aft fuselage and the center section and clecoed the side skins on.

Since I did not trim the longerons, I need side skins to be on to estimate the location of the notch on the longerons.
