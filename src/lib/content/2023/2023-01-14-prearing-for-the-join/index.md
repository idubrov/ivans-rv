Some preparations for the fuselage join.

<!-- more -->

First, I drilled the crotch strap brackets. This time, all the floors were installed, so I think it should be a good fit.

Next, I made another sawhorse.

Few other minor things, like dimpling the holes in the aft fuselage which will match the flange holes of the baggage ribs, clecoing, and screwing in the floors.

I was hoping my back-ordered parts will arrive today, but I misread the day of the week, they should arrive tomorrow. So I did a few other little things, like fabricating F-717 longerons and deburring the front longerons.
