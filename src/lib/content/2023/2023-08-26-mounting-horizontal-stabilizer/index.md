Few more holes, a lot of stressing over the holes, and the horizontal stabilizer is mounted.

<!-- more -->

First I made two spacers that go under the horizontal stabilizer front spar.

Then I drilled the spacers for the two outboard holes I drilled before, put them under the front spar, and drilled the two remaining inboard holes that attach the front spar of the horizontal stabilizer.

Nothing too special here, I measured the distance from the outboard holes and drilled them using the angle drill. A regular drill bit does not fit due to another angle on the stabilizer. It's not an issue with the outboard holes since that angle tapers and the drill fits.

To ream the holes, I got inside the fuselage and reamed them from the bottom, which worked well. This is what the holes look like from the inside, with some temporary fasteners installed.

Then I drilled the holes that attach the rear spar. Again, all the standard procedure: drill #30 holes, then upsize them to #12 for AN3 bolts.

(Why everything gets so dirty? Sheesh!)

After that, I mounted my elevators (which, as per tradition, took some sweating and swearing) and connected them to the bellcrank via the pushrod.

I checked if the pushrod could be unscrewed by turning it in one direction, and this is what I got on one side.

I don't know how many threads are left inside the rod end so the test is inconclusive. It did not fall apart, but if there is only one thread inside, it's no good.

The other side looked like this.

I wonder if for extra safety I can put another jam nut, just so it takes the space on the threads?

I did not install control sticks, but this is how it looks when I move them via the bellcrank.

They move smoothly, but there is maybe some small amount of friction in the left elevator. I think the inboard hinge is a bit tight. Also, there might be some tightness in the central bearing (I did not try to get the best spacer possible, will do it once I install elevators for real).
