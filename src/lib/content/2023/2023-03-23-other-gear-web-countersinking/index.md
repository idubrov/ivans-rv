Did the left F-7101 gear attach web and started countersinking the angles.

<!-- more -->

A bit more work in the last two days. First, I drilled the left F-7101 gear attach web.

The part itself.

Then I drilled both gear attach webs to the F-902 bulkheads. When I drilled the right one to the lower longeron, I put the hole centered on the longeron, which caused the hole to be a bit too close to the edge of the F-902 flange. The edge distance is about at the minimum for the -4 rivet. On the left bulkhead, I moved the hole by about 1/8" so it has a better edge distance.

Finally, I started countersinking various angles. The first ones were the floor stiffeners.

Finally, I started making the F-796 spacers.
