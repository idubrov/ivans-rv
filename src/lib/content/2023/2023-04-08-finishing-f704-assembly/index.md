Today I riveted the F-704 aft part to the central section and assembled the F-719 forward skin stiffeners.

I torqued the F-704 central section aft part to the seat ribs and riveted them. I used a double offset rivet set, which kind of works, but is a bit tricky to use. All the rivets turned out to be okay, but some of them have a slight smiley due to the tilting of the set: given the space available, it was a bit difficult to keep the rivet set exactly straight.

Then I assembled the forward stiffeners (the manufactured jolt part). -4 rivets look like a bit of an overkill
