Today I looked through all of my wing parts to see which of them are laser cut.

<!-- more -->

I found that pretty much all the ribs (except maybe four ribs), tank baffles, and stiffeners are all laser cut.

Waiting for Vans to start doing the replacements. It probably would take several months at the very least, maybe, even a year or more.

I think I am mostly finished with the fuselage for now. I cannot do the central tunnel because I need the fuel pump module and the fuel valve (I plan to use an electronic injection, so I need one of these duplex Andair valves).

For the forward, panel section, I need at the very least the after-market panel I want to use. Also, avionics so I can start thinking about the layout.

I don't want to buy any of that before I finish the wing, get the finishing kit, and start rebuilding the engine. But will see, if I will have nothing to do, I'll start installing at least some of the systems into the fuselage. For example, I can do antennas.

So, the next steps are probably going to be fitting the empennage, doing empennage fiberglass work, and waiting for the replacement parts for the wings.
