The same process, but for the horizontal stabilizer tips.

I've realized that I need to prepare the horizontal stabilizer fairing tips as well, so I could micro and then sand both fairings to get them to match.

First, I drilled the fairings to the horizontal stabilizer.

The next step was to prepare a blank that I could use as a closing cap. The plans offer two ways of closing the ends. The first option is to install a temporary foam block, and glass over it, then remove the block and add reinforcing layers of fiberglass cloth. The second option is to permanently glue in a foam/balsa block and simply add a filler over it.

I chose to go with the third option: create a fiberglass cap that will be glued to the end of the fairing. No specific reason why I decided to do it this way, but seemed like a simple option given the materials I have.

So I started with a slightly bowed piece of aluminum to be used as a mold. The bow roughly follows the radius of the sweep of the elevator fairing.

I covered it with cling wrap and then applied two layers of fiberglass cloth, soaking each layer with epoxy resin.

Finally, I prepared the aluminum backing strips for the rivets and glued them inside the fairings.
