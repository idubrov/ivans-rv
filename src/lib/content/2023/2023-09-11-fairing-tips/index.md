Got my fiberglass cloth, so worked a little bit on closing the fairing tips.

<!-- more -->

The idea was to cover the counterbalance weights with the Gorilla tape, and then apply the fiberglass cloth and epoxy. I pre-wet the cloth and then wrapped it around the counterbalance.

Initially, I did one layer but found that the tip was too thin, so I added another layer the next day (after scuffing the first one to get epoxy to bond).

Then I sanded the fairings a bit, just for a general shape. The next step would be to cover them with micro and sand them to the final shape. However, later I realized that I needed to prepare the horizontal stabilizer fairing tips as well, so I could sand both fairings to get them to match.

So, I'll work on the stabilizer fairings next.
