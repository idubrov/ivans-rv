Finished the central tunnel cover piece.

<!-- more -->

Initially, I thought of redoing the tunnel cover supports. The way I drilled them places them too far apart (1/8" too far) for the dimensions of the central cover given in the plans. However, I decided to leave them as is and just make the cover wider.
