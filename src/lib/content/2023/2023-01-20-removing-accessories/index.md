Removed accessories from the engine.

<!-- more -->

Started taking apart the engine. So far I've removed the accessories: the vacuum pad, the rear governor pad, the spin-on oil adapter, plugs, fittings from the accessory case, intake tubes, oil drain-back tubes, the alternator mounts, and the fuel injection system.

I use Superior Vantage Overhaul Manual, which is not exactly the same, but close enough. Some differences are that Aero Sport Power chose different parts when they assembled the engine (also, Superior Vantage is the certificated variant). Luckily, I have the full parts list from Aero Sport Power, so I can reference them.

So far the differences seem to be pretty minor: some parts are non-Superior parts (for example, the oil spin-on adapter) and sump plus intake tubes seem to be Aero Sport Power parts (not sure what the difference is, though).

I am throwing the parts in the bag without any cleaning for now. Once I have everything apart, I will clean the parts I want to reuse and store them under some LPS-3 coat in vacuum bags.

Also, I sent my tail spring mount for the powder coating. Once it is ready, I will finish the aft fuselage F-712 bulkhead.
