Got my tools for flaring and bending the aluminum tubes, so I decided to do the vent lines.

<!-- more -->

The material Vans provides in the kit is the 3003-O Versatube, which is a very soft aluminum tubing. I opted to use 5052-O instead, which is a stronger alloy. Also, it comes in straight lengths vs coils Vans provides their material in.

The process turned out to be much easier than I thought. The hardest part was the section that starts at the side of the fuselage (the fitting that is connected to the fuel tank on a wing). The main complexity there is that it needs to go around the longeron, and then go around the rudder cables, all in a very short section of the tubing.

However, after some experiments, I figured out the best way to bend it, in two bends done with the tool plus one bend done by hand. The bend I did by hand was the one closest to the fitting, as it is a very tight bend. To do it, I temporarily screwed a straight fitting and used it as a lever to bend the tube.

For all the sections I did bends using the Van's supplied material first, then replicated the same bends on the 5052-O tubes. The most artistic section was when the tube went from a horizontal section to a vertical one along the firewall. I kind of just eyeballed it using the soft tubing.

Did not take many pictures, but here is the result.

Also, I got an aftermarker fuel vents.
