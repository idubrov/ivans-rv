Today I worked on the fuel sender plate.

<!-- more -->

I riveted the nut plates and all the components to the fuel sender plate. I used the same technique I used for the reinforcement ring and the inboard ring -- a bit of the sealant on each of the nutplate, rivet them, then cover rivet shop ends with the sealant.

Now I'm ready to work on the most critical step of assembling the fuel tank -- the rear baffle.
