Small priming session to prime all the remaining ribs.

<!-- more -->

This was a short session to prime the ribs. This time I decided to put them on a chicken wire table instead of hanging them, as I thought it would be easier to spray small parts on the table. 


I much did better with the paint flow control this time, no issues with the primer strikes. However, since I had to spray the paint from multiple directions to cover all rib flanges, I missed a couple. Also, a few flanges were not covered enough -- I probably need better lighting in my paint booth. Otherwise, I don't see too well if I have parts without enough coverage. Also, somebody on VAF gave advice not to use a smoke gray color as it does not contrast much against the base aluminum color. I agree with that, but I love the smoke gray. Looks really nice.

Again, I used a regular paintbrush to cover flanges that did not get enough primer.

Another mistake was that I haven't thought that my chicken wire table pretty much sits on the ground (it does not have any legs) and the paint sprayer raised all the dust from the floor (which, in retrospect, I should have swept!)

Overall, it was a nice and sweet session, and now I have all parts of the horizontal stabilizer primed and ready for the final assembly!
