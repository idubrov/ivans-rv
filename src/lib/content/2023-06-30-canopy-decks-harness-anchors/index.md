A bit more riveting and drilling today.

<!-- more -->

First, I finished riveting the canopy decks.

There were a few places where my bucking bar would not fit, so I used a piece of cold rolled steel I had in my scrap bin.

Next, I drilled the holes for the F-636 shoulder harness anchors. The plans located them 1/8" from the outside edge of the longerons. However, that gives too little of the edge distance. But if you move them the full 1/8" outboard, there will be not enough space for the nut and the washer under the longerons. So I shifted them by 1/16" which both improved the edge distance on the longerons and gave enough space for the nut and the washer.

Finally, I riveted F-709 to the fuselage. The plans tell you to do that later, however. Not sure if it will make any difference.
