Continued working on the right wing.

<!-- more -->

There was not much to report over the last month as I was waiting for the new leading edge ribs to arrive. During that time I drilled both the bottom and the top skins to the wing skeleton (which still took couple of hours).

Here are the new ribs I received.

Interestingly, they also use a new "flimsy" design where instead of a single flange they have several sections. This makes it much easier to prepare these ribs because fluting is pretty much unnecessary.

Then I clecoed these ribs and the skin to the main wing structure.
