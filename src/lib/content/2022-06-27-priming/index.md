Today I primed the parts for the right elevator.

Same as usual. First, cleaned the parts with the EkoClean.

Then scuffed with EkoEtch and primed with EkoPoxy.

I also primed a small strip on the leading edge of the rudder (the part of the edge which goes under the edge from the other side).

Also, since Van's Builder Support did not approve my idea of using NAS1097 rivets, I counter-sinked the spar for the AN426AD3 rivets.
