The journey continues! Finally, I received my fuselage crate!

<!-- more -->

This is what I got a few days ago. A crate with the fuselage parts. I was hoping to get the wing kit earlier, but this will do, too. The interesting part is that I ordered the fuselage two months later (late May versus late March for the wing kit).

A lot of inventorying! The aluminum parts are easy to account for, but hardware is where it gets tedious.

Some of the hardware bags are just mean. Here I need to sort out 148 LP4-3 from 28 MSP-42 from 4 CS4-4. MSP-42 rivets are easy to tell from LP4-3, LP4-3 mandrel is smooth whereas MSP-42 is not. However, CS4-4 (only 4 of them!) are kind of hard to see, even though they have a flat head.

One of the bags contained the wrong rivet size, AN426AD3-3.5 instead of AN426AD3-4.5.

Finally, after a few days and many hours of inventorying, everything is on the shelves, in the hardware bins and boxes.

The next step is to work on the firewall bulkhead.
