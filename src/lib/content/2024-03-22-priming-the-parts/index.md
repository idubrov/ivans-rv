Today was a deburring, scuffing, and priming session!

<!-- more -->

First, I deburred all the aileron bracket parts. I figured that I didn't want to prime short (the spar doublers) and long (the spars themselves) parts together, so I decided to do the aileron brackets.

The aileron hinges are affected by the SB 16-03-28, so I deburred the parts from the Service Bulletin.

To deburr the thick aluminum parts I used a medium grit Scotch-Brite wheel. I had it for a while, but it is a bit too aggressive for thin aluminum. For thick pieces, however, it works much better than the soft ones!

Finally, I scuffed and primed all the parts, nothing too special here.
