Some amount of riveting was done today.

I started with the aft deck F-714.

Then I riveted a few rivets of the canopy rails.

Finally, the rudder brace.

I also found that my air compressor drain valve doesn't close too well. I replaced it with a new one and took the old one apart. Seems like the ball got damaged somehow (hard to see, but the slot is mangled a bit).
